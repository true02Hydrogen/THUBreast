<h2> Task Objectives :</h2>
THUBreast is developed by the Radiation Protection and Environmental Protection Laboratory of the Department of Engineering Physics of Tsinghua University, which is employed to generate the custom shape and anatomical parameters of the detailed breast model. In view of the need to provide a large number of digital breast phantoms for virtual clinical patients in VCTs, our laboratory constructed the generation process of detailed structure of breast phantoms according to the medical anatomical characteristics of breast. The purpose of this software is to improve the early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, as well as to provide an effective tool for mammary gland related biomedical research.

<h2>Operating Environment:</h2>
The procedure for configuring the environment is as follows: Install the environment according to the preinstallation of the user's computer:
<ul>
<li>Matlab R2021a or above version;</li>
<li>Install Curve Fitting Toolbox and Image Processing Toolbox</li>
</ul>

<h2>3D visualization:</h2>
<ul>
<li>View it in the App using the 3D volume viewer.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Input file</h2>
<p>You can refer to Input file in the arg folder for a b c d cup breas, and you can modify the volumetric glandular fraction (VGF) and voxel size (voxSize) in the main program.</p>
